I've decided to begin putting down my own personal approaches to things as "protocols", both for myself, and for anyone who might derive some utility from this bizarre practice.

**File naming:**  

* By default, all file names are structured like this: 20xx-xx-xx filename.txt  
* Tags may be added: 20xx-xx-xx TAGINCAPS filename.txt  
* Projects are grouped together in a small, flat folder structure. In this case, the file naming gets transferred to the folder: 20xx-xx-xx Project Name

**File Formats:**  

* Should be kept to a minimum. Use plain .txt for everything possible - .rtf after that.  
* If it's a music file, it should ideally be in lossless AIFF or mp3.  
* Todo lists are kept in plain .txt, but can be viewed and edited through Taskpaper.  
* Similarly, use Markdown if possible.  
* Try to replace Excel with CSV, where possible. Barring that, use Google Docs.  

**Photos:**  

* Use Picasa to import (doesn't lock in your files)  
* create a folder for that import (20xx-xx-xx picasa), and tell Picasa to import to that folder BY DATE TAKEN  
* this will create folders inside with each day photos were taken, and will contain the photos themselves a further layer down.
