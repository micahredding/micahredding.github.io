Ooooh...the excitement. We've updated our tour page system, so it's a lot better than it used to be. Now, the next upcoming concerts are actually at the top, and the ones after that are below, etc. Just like a real tourdate calendar should work. You can still see our past events with a "Previous Page" button at the bottom of the calendar.<br /><br />Only problem is, now you can't post comments on individual concerts. But there's always a price to pay, I guess.<br /><br />Yes, you heard right. Siah's not going to be playing with us this evening. He "forgot" about it, and didn't get a chance to ask off work. Oh well.<br /><br />Tomorrow is MORP...the ANTI-PROM.
