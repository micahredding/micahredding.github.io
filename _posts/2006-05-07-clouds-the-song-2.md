When I was in college, I spent a lot of time studying the events that happened in the first century. They captivated my imagination, and in them I saw a vision of some of the monumental shifts occuring behind the scenes...shifts that totally changed the way the world works, and reshaped the paths of history.<br /><br />These massive changes ultimately revolved around a small group of rebels who dared to question everything they'd ever known. Their sacrifices built the future, and changed the world we live in.<br /><br />I was inspired by all this, and I wrote the song "Clouds".<br /><br />-micah
