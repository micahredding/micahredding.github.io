Experience would indicate this universe is not intended to be hackable in the sense specified here, and is instead intended to be understood and manipulated within the rules of its operation. That is, the hacking allowed is to openly access and read the rules of the simulation. Root access isn't given, nor universal eval functions (which is good, otherwise we'd overwrite everyone). It may be that we have to achieve something before being given access, or it may be that the ground rules are so open, we don't need higher access (ie, this is the rooted-ist set of physical laws which are coherent). Either way, evidence suggests we aren't intended, and won't be allowed, to hack out of it until something changes.
