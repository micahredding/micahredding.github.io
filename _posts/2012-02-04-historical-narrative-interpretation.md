The idea that the scriptures should be understood as stories and conversations arising within particular circumstances in world history. As such, they should not be interpreted as if we were reading a theological text, an encyclopedia, a set of moral rules, or a philosophical work. Instead, we should seek to understand the story as they saw themselves within it, and try to tease out where the arc of that story leaves us today.

Particularly expressed by [Andrew Perriman](http://www.postost.net/).
