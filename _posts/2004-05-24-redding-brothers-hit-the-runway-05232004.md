HUNTINGTON, WV - On May 23 at 2:00 p.m., the Redding Brothers performed at the Elite Model Search "Half-Time Show" at the Huntington Mall, playing to a huge audience of contestants and bystanders. Due to technical difficulties with the mall's in-house sound system, the dynamic Reddings took it upon themselves to modify the show onstage, and brought the concert to an exciting -- though completely unrehearsed -- finale. Their actual intended set-list can be seen here.
