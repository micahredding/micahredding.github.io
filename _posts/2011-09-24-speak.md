The first chapter of the gospel of John famously connects Jesus to *the Word*. I've always understood that to refer to the spoken word of God, the same word that said "Let there be light", and spoke the worlds into existence. 

It just occurred to me that Jesus, in fact, never wrote. He only spoke out loud. Later on, people wrote down his words, but he himself never wrote. I wonder if that means anything. What is the significance of the fact that God and Jesus both speak, but never write? What is the significance of the fact that Jesus is called the Word, not the Letter?
