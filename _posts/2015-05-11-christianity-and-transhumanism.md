What does Christianity have to say about radical life extension? Cyborgs? Artificial Intelligence? 

I'm passionately interested in these questions. I grew up as a preacher's kid, and traveled the world as a rock musician. Now I'm a software developer â€” and dedicated to exploring the intersection of religion, technology, and the future of humanity.

This is where I explore and unpack these subjects. Enter your email to get occasional in-depth essays on this and related topics.
