RM is an abbreviation that means something about being a Mormon missionary. Never would have guessed that this would be a topic for a smart, irreverent, perfectly appropriate and family-friendly comedy that ranks up there with the best of today's (usually less than appropriate) comedies.
<br />
<br />What makes it great is the soundtrack, which consists of redone traditional hymns alongside punk-rock sing-alongs about being a missionary. The irony pushes the soundtrack into True Greatness.
<br />
<br />Somehow or another, this movie manages to make fun of everything about Mormons (and a lot of church people, in general), without being offensive or sacrilegious.
<br />
<br />It's not the greatest comedy, but it's brave, original, and worth watching for the shear pleasure of being able to talk about a movie about Mormons.
<br />
<br />Mormons should like it too.
