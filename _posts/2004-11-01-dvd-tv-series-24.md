I'm almost finished with the second volume of the first season. This is a great show, very original, entertaining and compelling.
<br />
<br />Everything happens in real-time, which is an awesome idea for a show. In other words, the show is an hour long, and covers exactly an hour of plot-time. When the show breaks for commercials, it comes back in exactly that length of time later. The season is 24 episodes long. It's awesome.
<br />
<br />It basically has several different stories which intersect going on at the same time. The main guy's daughter gets kidnapped, terrorists plot to kill a presidential candidate, the candidate has some personal family issues going on, etc, etc.
<br />
<br />And how awesome is it to watch a bunch of people stay up 24 hours at a time?
