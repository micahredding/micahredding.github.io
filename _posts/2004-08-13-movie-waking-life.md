Waking Life is one of the most interesting movies I've watched in a while. First of all, it's animated. Second of all, the animation is different than anything I've seen. They actually recorded the whole movie with live-action actors and cameras and everything; and THEN went back and animated over it. As a result, the animation is very detailed, and follows real-life motion.
<br />
<br />Third of all, this movie is basically one big dream sequence...consisting of random people dialoguing on philosophy. At times it's hilarious, at times profound, and often weird. It deals in depth with the idea of lucid dreaming, and how you can know if you're living in a dream or not.
<br />
<br />If you're not into philosophy, it'll probably run a little slow for you; but it is funny just because it has bizarre people randomly discussing bizarre philosophy with strangers, while walking, and while bumping into you as they pass. It even has a guy driving a boat down the highway.
<br />
<br />In other words, this is a great movie. Very original.
<br />
<br />**** 4 Stars.
