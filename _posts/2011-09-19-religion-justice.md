Most people frame religion as primarily an ethical phenomenon, concerned with how people behave and conduct society. I think that's incorrect. It fails to account for prevailing interest in deities and the afterlife, it fails to address the particular ways people approach their religious views.

No, religion is not concerned with ethics, it's concerned with *justice*.

Justice is about how things get set right. Ethics are about how we side with justice, but justice itself, the language and breath of religion, draws us into thinking about humanity and transcendance and immortality. Our pursuit of justice leads us to religion, and our pursuit of justice leads us beyond it.
