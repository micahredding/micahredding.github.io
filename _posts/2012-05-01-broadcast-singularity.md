Since our second official episode just went up, I thought it would be good to point out that I'm doing a podcast. This podcast is about the future, the Singularity, and what it's like to experience *life on the curve*.  
  
So far, we've had some great conversations. Our first episode was about art and technology and the future of the two, and our latest episode is about whether we are pessimistic or optimistic about what the future holds.   

Please [check it out](http://brickcaster.com/singularity), subscribe in [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/broadcast-the-singularity/id495667410), and spread it around to anyone you think might be interested. Also, send your ideas and questions, or let us know if you'd like to be a guest!
