A middle-weight suspense movie about the dark side of the Catholic church - and all the beliefs and practices it wanted to forget about. Basically a kind of sidelined priest discovers some underground supernatural creatures that the Church doesn't really want to believe in anymore, despite the fact that it has some secret knowledge about how to dispatch them.
<br />
<br />Long story short - the priest becomes one of these creatures.
<br />
<br />Interesting; good, not great.
