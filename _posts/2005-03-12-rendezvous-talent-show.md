Well, it was that time again. The ever-popular Rendezvous Local Talent Showcase went off without a...err, too many...hitches. Here was the lineup:<br /><br />Scott &amp; Claire Rogan (returning bluegrass maestros)<br />Aaron Johnson (debuting violinist)<br />Tyler Gillis &amp; Grant Carol (new guitar &amp; vocal performers)<br />July (returning vocal &amp; guitarists...who sold out of all their cds at this show)<br />Ryan Angus (returning guitarist &amp; vocalist)<br />Walt Nordstrom (returning poetic genius)<br />The Redding Brothers (that's us)<br /><br />Everyone was great, by the way.<br /><br />-Micah
