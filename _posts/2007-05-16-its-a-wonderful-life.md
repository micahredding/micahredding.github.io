I realized that I am a fortunate person. Even when all kinds of little things in my life are going wrong (my car's radiator and AC condenser got smashed in, leaving me with radiator repair debt and no AC; I dropped a glass bottle of tea in a convenience store and it smashed, leaving the cashiers mean and unhappy), lots of big things are going right.<br /><br />Like how our speakers went out this weekend in Paducah, KY, and after our manager made a few calls, a guy I've never met bought us a MUCH more expensive set of new ones.<br /><br />When you think about it, that's a pretty profound thing to have happen.<br /><br />-micah
