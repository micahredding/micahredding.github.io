Hope everyone survived the holidays okay. Siah's still in Washington State, we're getting ready to "ring in the New Year's", and everyone's still trying to recover from Christmas. We're gearing up for our next concert in Cincinnati on January 8th, and we've got a whole lot of stuff in the works right now. Our next event in WV is the Open Mic Night we're hosting at Rendezvous (in Teays Valley) on Friday, January 14th. If you'd like to be a part of that, just contact us.
<br />
<br />Happy New Year's Eve.
