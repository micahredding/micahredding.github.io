I'm actually too young to be sure if the title of this post makes a meaningful reference or not. I'm guessing it does, however, and am continuing on that assumption.<br /><br />For the past few months, I haven't blogged, and wanted to start again, so I thought it fitting to describe briefly what I have been doing for that time.<br /><br />First of all, I got married. Then, I undertook a long tour of college conventions and concerts across the country. Then, I picked up Facebook. Then, I began to consider how a person such as myself can facilitate a change of state in people's mentality.<br /><br />This is what I have been considering and mulling over continuously for quite some time. My informal research has involved talking with hypnotists, public speakers, educators, and magicians, observing a wide variety of performances, reading interviews with Bono of U2, experimenting with Facebook, designing some web applications, engaging in a little bit of spoken word performance, and throwing a concert using some of my new ideas.<br /><br />I sense that something is there to be uncovered. I feel like revolutions in people's thinking can and do happen. Right now, I'm thinking that what is needed is "truth".<br /><br />Truth is what changes people.<br /><br />But truth can't just be spoken. It has to be "realized". And that may involve stories, acting, movies, music, food, or experiences.<br /><br />And I am looking to provide all of those things.<br /><br />-micah
