It's coming, I know it is. The time when Christians will wake up and realize that:<br /><br /><blockquote>"Any government powerful enough to give you whatever you want is also powerful enough to take away everything you have."</blockquote><br />Christians will need to learn to distance themselves from the politics of power that are so often part of the "christian vocabulary" today. Correspondingly, libertarians will have to wake up to the essential "christian-ness" of their belief system.<br /><br />After all, if we were to decide to create a <span style="font-style:italic;">truly, deeply, Christian</span> political party, what principle could be better to enact than "do no harm"? The libertarian position is that we take this principle, and apply it VERY consistently to government.<br /><br />So I have been on a web-search for other Christian Libertarians out there like me. Here's what I've got so far.<br /><br /><a href="http://voxday.blogspot.com/">Vox Day, a Christian libertarian commentator from WorldNetDaily</a><br />Interesting, very "citeful". I think I just invented that word.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/yates/yates87.html">Steven Yates: How I Became A Christian Libertarian</a><br />A rather involved, but reasoned history of the progression of his beliefs.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.self-gov.org/christian/">The Christian Resources page at self-gov.org</a><br />Favorite Quote:<br /><blockquote>"Jesus Christ fasted for 40 days and 40 nights in the wilderness. At the end of the 40 days, Satan took him to the mountaintop and offered Jesus Christ dominion over the world... if Jesus would kneel down and worship him. Satan offered Jesus political power and Jesus responded, 'My kingdom is not of this world.'<br /><br />"Jesus turned down political power.<br /><br />"Was Jesus wrong?"<br /><br />-- Michael Cloud </blockquote>
