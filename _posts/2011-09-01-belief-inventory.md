I have stumbled onto some unusual beliefs in my life, and thought it'd be interesting to try to catalog what they are.

* fulfilled eschatology (preterism, transmillennialism, post-apocalyptic)
* christus victor atonement theology (as understood by...)
* walter wink's analysis of the powers as societal psychology
* bicameralism (see the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind)
  _...setting the backdrop for the biblical story as told by..._
* the gifts of the jews
* the multiverse
* quantum immortality (implication of the multiverse)
* free will (as implied by the multiverse)
* the omega point (culmination of the multiverse in complete unification)
* non-dualist definition of human
* importance of physical, historical existence
