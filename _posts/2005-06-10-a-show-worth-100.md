I went out to see <a href="http://www.gentrymorris.com/">Gentry Morris</a> perform at a $5 show. But while I was there, my car got towed, and the show turned into a $100 show. A $100 that I don't have, seeing as my company hasn't managed to pay me after 4 weeks. But that's all irrelevant.<br /><br />Gentry is great. He and I went to school together back in the day, and he moved to Nashville to become a rock star. Check out his website.<br /><br />-Micah
