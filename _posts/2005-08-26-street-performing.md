Tried the street performing thing. It was on a Thursday night, so it wasn't the busiest time. And I only stayed out there 30 minutes.<br /><br />But it was fun. Lots of people talked to me. The homeless people gave me space; kinda like professional respect, as it were. Lots of people talked about how young I looked. Guess I didn't fit the old &amp; homeless profile.<br /><br />I also made some money...I don't know, but it would probably be more than I make at my real job.<br /><br />But in the end, it's probably not for me.<br /><br />Ahhh well.<br /><br />-micah
