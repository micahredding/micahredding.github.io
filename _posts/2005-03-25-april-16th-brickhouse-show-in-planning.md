We are officially putting on a show at...<br /><br />The Brickhouse (52 Old Main St, St. Albans, WV)<br />Saturday, April 16th<br />6:00pm<br /><br />Tentative Lineup is:<br />-Vintage Tone<br />-Fletcher's Grove<br />-The Jiants<br />-One Last Call<br />-The Redding Brothers<br /><br />Tickets are $6 in advance, $7 at the door. This will be different than any Brickhouse show you've EVER BEEN TO! We've got interesting things in the works. We will probably have a "home music video" showing, cheap concessions, and a lot more!<br /><br />Love you all!<br /><br />-micah<br /><br />PS. If you want to help out with this event, we'd love to have you in the inner circle...just drop us an <a href="mailto:micahtredding@yahoo.com">email</a>. You'll still have to pay to get in (it's expensive to rent the place!), but we will richly reward you with love and still-secret merchandise.
