In my <a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/content/view/268/38/">bio</a>, I refer to a time when I detained a criminal while waiting for the police to arrive. I was recently asked for details about this incident, so I thought I would convey the story. A warning: I didn't use any physical violence to detain this criminal, so none of my celebrated hand-to-hand combat skills are described here.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">The STORY about The CRIMINAL...</span><br /><br />I was working at Motel 6 in Everett, WA during a Summer break. My boss lived in the Motel, and would watch me on camera from time to time without me knowing.<br /><br />So I was checking in this one lady, when I received a phone call. I picked it up, and it was from my manager.<br /><br />"Don't let her go!" she exclaimed. "The police are on their way, and they need you to detain her so she can't get into a room. They've asked for our help in capturing her."<br /><br />"Ok," I answered, and mimicked having a full conversation with a customer before hanging up the phone. It didn't occur to me that everyone was wanting me to be the one staying in danger.<br /><br />So I took my time checking her in, and when she had a request for something to be changed, I told her I wasn't sure if I could do that. I took my time fumbling around and acting incompetent.<br /><br />When I finally finished with her, I gave her the keys to get in her room. She walked out the door and into the hands of the just-arriving police force.<br /><br />Since I am a nice guy, I gave her a refund on her rooms before they took her away.<br /><br />....<br /><br />Later on, a bank robber hid out in our motel and the police surrounded us, but that's another story.<br /><br />-micah
