I received <a href="http://www.ztheband.com/index.php">Zehnder</a>'s newest album: "Going Up" the other day. It's being offered as worship music.<br /><br />It sounds quite unique. I wonder if they anticipate other people singing along to this? I don't really think it has either the hymn-like or devo-song feel that allows for people to sing along. But that doesn't mean it's bad. It just means it's not simple and repetitive.<br /><br />The album's sound is kind of "acoustic L.A." It reminds me vaguely of Alanis Morissette. But it is more acoustic, and definitely, uh, more christian.<br /><br />Ultimately, it might be really good for getting into a kind of mystical trance. You might like it.
