In case you hadn't read our website recently, we've embarked on a new project: to write a new song every week, record it, and release it by Saturday night at  midnight.<br /><br />It's a tough gig forcing creativity upon yourself. But it's also a liberating one, and an inspiring one, and a re-awakening one.<br /><br />Maybe I had been in a creative slumber because it was Winter. Maybe it's getting close to Summer, and it's time to re-awaken.<br /><br />I've started working out, I've started writing a new song a week, I've started spending more time with friends, and more time outside in the sunlight. I've got renewed purpose, perhaps. And there's nothing like a self-challenge to keep you awake and alive.<br /><br />Anyway, tonight at midnight we should have a new song for you. If we finish it. :) Stay tuned...<br /><br />See the <a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/content/category/6/18/37/">First Song-A-Week</a>, from last week.<br /><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/reddingbrothersvideopodcast">Subscribe to the Song-A-Week</a>, and get the new one tonight.
