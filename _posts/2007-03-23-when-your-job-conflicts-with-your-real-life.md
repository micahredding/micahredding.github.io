It sounds silly, but what happens when your job conflicts with your real life? When your job keeps you too stressed to function well when you are off?<br /><br />This is a catch-22 situation. If you keep your stressful job, you won't be able to enjoy your life, but if you quit, you won't have enough money to enjoy your life.<br /><br />I have just stepped down from the position of full-time instructor at Draughons Junior College, and have taken a new part-time role. This is not so much due to "having too much money from being a rock star", as it is due to "having too much to do as a musician to keep up this full-time job".<br /><br />Over the last couple of months, it has been pretty stressful, and I got to the point of utter mental exhaustion. That is saying a lot; I'm the one who never sleeps, who plays shows back-to-back-to-back and is happy about it, and who is always pressuring everyone to work, work, work.<br /><br />But I realized I couldn't really fathom the thought of keeping up my teaching schedule and doing all this band stuff anymore. And that's good. After all, who doesn't want to be kept busy doing what they love?<br /><br />So that just means I am going to have to trust that the money will come. And I do.<br /><br />I feel so relaxed.<br /><br />-micah
