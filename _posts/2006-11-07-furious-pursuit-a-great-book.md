And it's awesome. I've gotten my girlfriend to read it, and I'm going to get my parents and friends to read it too.<br /><br />The book says that God will never let you go.<br /><br />And you've got to let that sink in for a minute, because that's exactly what it means. <br /><br />Not: "won't let you go...for a while."<br />Not: "will never let you go...unless..."<br />Not: "God's great...but..."<br /><br />God will never let you go.<br /><br />Read it.<br /><br />-micah
