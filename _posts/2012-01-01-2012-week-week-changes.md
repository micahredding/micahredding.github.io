Read the setup [here](http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/01/01/new-years-resolve-change). These are my [changes for 2012].

Week 1: Drink no soda.  
*If anything, this experiment had a negative impact on my life. But I discovered that I really didn't need or miss it.*

Week 2: A world without coffee.  
*Argggghhh!*

Week 3: Drink 5-hour energy every day!  
*I didn't do well with this one. I would forget to take one until late in the day, and then would only drink a half-bottle (recommended dosage, but a little light-weight). I don't think it affected me very much.*

Week 4: A week without time!  
*This went so well, I forgot a new week had started, and it was Tuesday before I began the next week...*

Week 5: No cream in my coffee, no milk, no liquid dairy.  
*Tough.*

Week 6: No data plan on my phone!  
*Meaning, my phone has full functionality when I have a wi-fi signal, and the rest of the time is more or less like an average phone.*

WEEK 7: No restraints!  
*Meaning, no more restrictions like these last few. :)*

WEEK 8: Get up earlier every day.  
*Started with 7am, and worked backwards.*

WEEK 9: Return to Tim Ferriss eating patterns.   
*Feel a lot better*  
  
WEEK 10: Go to bed before 10pm.
*Sorta...*  

WEEK 11: Hand-wash an item of clothing every day.  
*Apparently, drying is the biggest part of washing.*  
  
WEEK 12: This week I'm doing three things: NOT drinking coffee or tea before bed, taking back up shaving cream (which I haven't used in years), and carrying around my new Platypus water bottle.  
  
WEEK 13: "Go out" every evening, do something interesting every night.

WEEK 14: No wheat, yes sugar.  
*Unless under the influence of Mormons... ;)*

WEEK 15: No talk radio, no podcasts, etc.
*Happier*

WEEK 16:
...
