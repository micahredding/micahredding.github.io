I took this test to find my Autism Quotient, and I got a 10, which is below average. 11+ is average. This is essentially measuring your inability to socialize...the higher the number, the less ability you have to deal with social situations. I wonder what it's like for a test to tell you you're border-line autistic.<br /><br />Let me know what you score:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/modules/newsweek/autism_quotient/default.asp">http://www.msnbc.com/modules/newsweek/autism_quotient/default.asp</a><br /><br />-micah
