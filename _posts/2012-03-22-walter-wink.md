Walter Wink is primarily significant to me for his work in defining the concept of *The Powers* and tying that together with Christus Victor atonement theory. Briefly put, his idea is that the scriptural world-view is based on seeing humanity as controlled by legions of different "principalities and powers". He suggests that we take this viewpoint seriously, and explains how they were referring to the very real cultural forces that are present in everything from mobs to political institutions.

I've written about that concept [here](http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/22/aliens-among-us) and about the worldview in my series [Christianity as Anthropology](http://micahredding.com/blog/series/christianity-anthropology).  

I've read his *Powers Trilogy*, and then the more summary work "The Powers That Be".
