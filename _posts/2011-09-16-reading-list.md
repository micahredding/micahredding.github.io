Here are the books that I consider foundational for me. Not because I agree with all of them, but because they are all part of me.

- The Physics of Immortality
- The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind
- The Gifts of The Jews
- The Powers That Be (Walter Wink)
- The Riverworld Series (Farmer)
- The Foundation Trilogy
- Dune (Frank Herbert)
- His Dark Materials (Philip Pullman)
