I watched the Coldplay performance on SNL tonight. I imagine there will be a lot of different impressions of the songs, but I felt like Christ Martin demonstrated himself to be someone who throws himself into his performances - even if that is sometimes awkward.

That is my aspiration - to reach for what is real and spontaneous and scary in a performance, even when it requires stepping out into new territory.
