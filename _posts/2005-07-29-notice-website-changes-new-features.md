<img src="/images/ipodband.gif" width="150" align="left" hspace="10">In the next couple of days, the website will be undergoing some major renovations, so if you experience a lack of service or an error message, please be patient and check back soon. And believe us, the changes will be more than worth it.<br /><br />These new renovations will bring a new level of interactivity to the website for all visitors, including new features like the "Redding Brothers Profile" system that will allow you to log-on to our website and interact with the band, as well as other fans, on our soon-to-be-launched messageboards, chat room, and private message system. The login system will also host a referral program with bonuses &amp; free merchandise to the top referrers, our new online "members only" fan club, a new "members-only" street team, and an interactive photo page that will allow you -- the visitor -- to post YOUR OWN photos for everyone to see.<br /><br />Sound cool?<br /><br />We thought so too. Completion is scheduled for the beginning of August. So, please be patient while we're upgrading our site, and if you have any questions, just click on the "contact" tab above, and we'll be happy to answer them for you. Thanks everyone!
