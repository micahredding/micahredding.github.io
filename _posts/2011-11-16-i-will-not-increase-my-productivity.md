New resolve:

I will not attempt to increase my productivity.

For years now, sites like [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com) and the original [43 Folders](http://43folders.com/) functioned by telling us small tips and tricks for improving our productivity and effectiveness. But that endeavor can easily become an obsession, and that obsession can suck your attention, and then your time, bone-dry.

One way to deal with that is to try decrease the time you spend reading productivity sites. But that is a self-reinforcing addict's move. The more you try to resist productivity sites, the more you focus on the productivity you're trying to gain by doing so. And so you're driven back into their arms.

So I'm going to read productivity sites. And I will continue to tweak my writing setup, and where I keep my files, and how I organize all the little to-dos in my life.. But I'm not going to do so for *productivity*. I will do so for the purposes I find along the way, and sometimes, just for the joy of tweaking. And I will give up the idea that I'm working towards some kind of optimal productivity or organization. Instead, I'll just enjoy the work, and the work of the work, and the work of the work of the work.

And just like that, I'm free.
