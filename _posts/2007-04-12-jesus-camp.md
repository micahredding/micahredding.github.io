I just watched "Jesus Camp".<br /><br />I was struck.<br /><br />I realized why people on TV act as if Christians are strange. Apparently, they are. I've never really been around those kind of Christians. Apparently these are the "evangelicals".<br /><br />I was raised in a really conservative church, but it wasn't like this. We didn't believe in speaking in tongues, in being overly emotive about Jesus, or in letting kids testify and harp about hellfire and brimstone.<br /><br />Now, I realize that everybody looks silly if put on camera at the wrong time. We shouldn't judge people because of documentaries. And I realize that not all of this stuff is bad.<br /><br />Bad theology is the problem here. Kids talking about hellfire and brimstone is freaky because it highlights where theology has gone wrong. But the theology was bad in the first place.<br /><br />-micah
