9/25/04 - The concert that actually didn't happen. During the first half of the show, 3 guitar strings were broken, several cables malfunctioned, and the sound system spontaneously changed volumes. During the second half, the guitar pickup stopped working altogether, leaving us guitar-less. To make a long story short...it was the worst show in our history. After surviving that, we are optimistic about the future. :)
