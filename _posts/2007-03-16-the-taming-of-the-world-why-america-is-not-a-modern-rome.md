I was considering today how much God has changed the world.<br /><br />Consider the fact that today we have a significant minority of people who feel that capital punishment is WRONG, and feel strongly about it. Further, the majority of people in America feel that capital punishment should only be used in the most extreme cases. <br /><br />Where did people get the idea that convicted killers, rapists, and thieves should be shown mercy?<br /><br />Some people have lamented that America is becoming a modern Rome. But did Rome have people gathering around crucifixion sites to protest? Weren't they instead gathering around to enjoy the spectacle? To join in the fun of torturing others?<br /><br />It doesn't matter how you feel about capital punishment. This shows a remarkable change; an enormous increase in human empathy, even if it is misdirected.<br /><br />It also isn't saying that America or the rest of the modern world is perfect. We still have our spectacles; we still enjoy the downfall of others. But we're changing, very slowly, but surely.<br /><br />It appears to me that since Jesus, God has begun to rule in a different way, from the bottom up, slowly changing people and society.<br /><br />Could Jesus have been alluding to this when he used growth metaphors in describing the kingdom of God? When he compared the kingdom to yeast?<br /><br />-micah
