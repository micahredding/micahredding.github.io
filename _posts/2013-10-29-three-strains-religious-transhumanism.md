I think that there are three strains of religious and spiritual transhumanism.

The first seeks to understand and commit more deeply to its own religious heritage, and in doing so, discovers a call to creation, cultivation of life, and self-transcendence. This definitely [applies to me](http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/04/25/christianity-transhumanism).

The second one seeks to grapple with metaphysics and cosmology, and in discovering transhumanism, finds a new and vibrant way to engage with the deepest of philosophical and spiritual problems. This [applies to me](http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/09/12/some-simulation-argument-flowcharts) as well.

The third one finds it difficult to believe the traditional claims of religion. But rather than abandoning those claims, it finds in them a plan for action. If the sick are not healed, we will work to heal the sick. If the dead are not raised, we will work to raise the dead. If the kingdom is not coming, we will work to bring the kingdom.

In my darker moments, when I suspect that all of my thought and reason and philosophy is mistaken — worse, that rationality itself is a sort of delusion — this last thought is what holds me together. Beyond modernism and postmodernism and epistemology upon epistemology, [there is action](http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/03/05/arguing-about-bible), and action is the ultimate meaning of *faith* — the daring commitment to step out into the nothingness and begin to build.

Regardless of which strain you may lean towards, they are all necessary, needed, valuable, and welcome.
