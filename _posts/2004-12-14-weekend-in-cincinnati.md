So, we spent the weekend in Cincinnati performing. Siah even rescheduled his ACT to take place in Cincinnati so we could pull it off. Chalk it up to another crazy thing we've done.
<br />
<br />Anyway, it was great. We played at Everybody's Records on Saturday, and they were really nice. And it's always great to be playing surrounded by vinyl. Our cousins surprised us by showing up, so we spent some time with them.
<br />
<br />This weekend, we're heading to Hillsboro and Columbus. We're busy building a trailer to hold all the stuff we'll need this weekend, as well as making more tshirts and all kinds of junk, er, I mean, merchandise. :) So besides working ourselves to death trying to get everything done, we're having a lot of fun.
<br />
<br />Muffins with cream cheese are surprisingly good.
