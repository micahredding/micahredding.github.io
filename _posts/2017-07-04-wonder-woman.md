For CS Lewis, Adam and Eve were a vision of humanity as it could be, in its full power and beauty. They were man and woman unchained, gods and goddesses walking the Earth, intense and fierce, full of fiery and dangerous grace.

Superheroes are our best approximation of what CS Lewis was getting at. They show us what we are, in our truest form. They show us man and woman in full glorification.

[Wonder Woman](https://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Woman-Gal-Gadot/dp/B072FNHS9P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1520546142&sr=8-3&keywords=wonder+woman&linkCode=ll1&tag=micahredding-20&linkId=352dc0a2c2613fdaa8b4a13690ffbcfb) captures this more fully than anything I've seen. She is Eve, leaving Eden on her God-given mission to redeem creation. She is pure and righteous intentionalityâ€”uncorrupted power shining through a dark world.
