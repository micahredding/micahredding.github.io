This weekend was Thanksgiving. Everybody was eating huge meals, watching parades and football ... and expressing gratitude. It's funny how we feel the need to have holidays for those things we should be doing all the time.<br /><br />With that in mind, I wanted to express my gratitude to everyone who's ever...<br /><br /><br />* Listened to <a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/">our album</a><br /><br />* Shared our album with your friends<br /><br />* Come to our concerts<br /><br />* Spent time on our <a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/">website</a><br /><br />* Read <a href="http://www.micahredding.com/">this blog</a><br /><br />* Encouraged me to keep going<br /><br />* Sent me some honest feedback - good or bad<br /><br /><br />You are what make my dreams possible. If you've ever taken the time to pay attention to this adventure I'm on, you are what I am unbelievably thankful for, and even though I don't express it enough, know that I am really, truly, grateful, from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />-micah
