Gotta say it, MORP was awesome. Gregg Oxley put this thing on, and it was great. The lineup was something like this:<br /><br />*Fletcher's Grove (Ryan Krofcheck, Matt, &amp; Evan)<br />Another Band with a girl singer (named Maura) that had an awesome voice<br /><a href="http://www.purevolume.com/atdawnwedie/">At Dawn We Die</a><br /><a href="http://www.onelastcall.net">One Last Call</a> - pop/rock/emo<br /><a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/">The Redding Brothers</a> (that's us)<br /><a href="http://www.fairweatherfan.net">Fairweather Fan</a><br />*<a href="http://www.purevolume.com/thepresentcrisis">The Present Crisis</a><br /><a href="http://www.scenesfromamovie.com">Scenes From A Movie</a><br /><br />I missed some of the names of the bands...if anyone knows them, let me know. Anyway, it was great; haven't had that much fun at a concert in a while.<br /><br />-Micah<br /><br />* (Played at the Talent Showcase on Friday)
