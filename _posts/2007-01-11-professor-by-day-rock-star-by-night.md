In the story of Spider-man, Peter Parker is always trying to juggle his twin duties of holding down a normal life (as, say, a college student), and living up to the huge demands of being Spider-man. This results in all kinds of havoc being wreaked: late assignments, difficulty keeping a good relationship going in his life, estranged friends.<br /><br />Well, I feel like my "Professor by Day, Rock Star by Night" lifestyle is starting to catch up to me too.<br /><br />True, I may be painfully cool teaching cutting edge computer science to my students, only to disappear into a swirl of bright lights and a fog machine, but it's not as easy as it looks.<br /><br />Like tonight, when I fell asleep in my computer class. Um, I think teachers are not supposed to fall asleep during their own presentations.<br /><br />-micah
