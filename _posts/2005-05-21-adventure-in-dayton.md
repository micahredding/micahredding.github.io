Last night was our Dayton Borders Cafe show...though *some* band members thought it was the Attic Club show (scheduled for tonight, not last night) and went to the completely wrong side of town. Micah drove up from our soon-to-be new headquarters of Nashville, TN, while Gabe and I came from Scott Depot, WV...forgetting to bring a cellphone, map, or any other kind of useful tool that you would normally think to bring on a trip. But eventually, after purchasing a phone card from a local CVS and buying an oversized map, me and Gabe found our way to the Borders Cafe and had a great show. Our pals from Dayton University showed up and we hung out after the show talking about our past adventures with car breakdowns and freaky old men. I think we almost convinced them to move to Nashville with us and rent an OCTOPLEX (duplex x 4 = octoplex)...sorry...inside joke :-). Anyway, we had a fun show last night. We'll see everyone tonight at the Attic Club. -Siah
