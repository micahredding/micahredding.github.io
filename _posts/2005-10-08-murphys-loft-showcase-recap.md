The Murphy's Loft showcase was great. We had <a href="http://www.robhawkins.com/">Rob Hawkins</a> open up, followed by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/shelleyraymond">Shelley Raymond</a> (a graduate of the Edgehill Studios Showcase who has an awesome stage presence). Then Seth Harper played an interesting collection of acoustic rock, including a cover song from the Gin Blossoms. 

Be sure to check out his song "Kramer's Wall" on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sethharper">myspace.com/sethharper</a>. 

Finally, <a href="http://www.weethepeople.us/">Wee The People</a>, including Shawn on guitar, and Clara (fresh from touring in Europe) on keyboards, played an awesome alt-pop set.<br /><br />To wrap it all up, I sang a couple of songs, then drank a coffee milkshake.<br /><br />-Micah
