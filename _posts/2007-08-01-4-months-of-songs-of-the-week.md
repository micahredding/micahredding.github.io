If you haven't noticed yet, we've just completed FOUR MONTHS of writing, recording, and releasing one new song every week - every Saturday at midnight. In doing so, we've had a lot of variety, from sappy songs to 90s-esque to the downright weird. The last one was in fact, a Haiku song, which seems to be a variety of poetry I've invented myself.<br /><br />I just found out that this weekend we will be on the radio in the heart of Jersey. Next weekend, who knows?<br /><br />-micah
