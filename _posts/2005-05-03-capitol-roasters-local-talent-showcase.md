THIS Friday, we're stepping out on a limb. We're expanding our Local Talent Showcase to Capitol Roasters in Charleston. It'll be exciting - big venue, nice place, right in the heart of Charleston, etc, etc.<br /><br />This is the way the show works. All kinds of people sign up (like Daffy Duck, lately). We screen the people through auditions, listening to demo cds, or having heard them play...and pick a final list of about 8 people. Then we actually host the show, and perform at the end. It's a lot of fun, we get to hear a lot of good performers, and it keeps things interesting.<br /><br />So this Friday is the first one ever at Capitol Roasters. If it goes well, it will become a regular event. Right now, we're excited about it. Hope to see you there!<br /><br />Capitol Roasters (160 Summers St, Charleston, WV)<br />Friday, 6 May 2005<br />8:00-10:00pm<br /><br />-Micah
