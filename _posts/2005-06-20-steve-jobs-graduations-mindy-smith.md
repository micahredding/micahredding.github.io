This is an interesting <a href="http://www.indiemusician.com/2005/06/youve_got_to_fi.html">Commencement Address</a> by Steve Jobs. Maybe we should make it into a song. Oh wait...<br /><br />In other news, I met <a href="http://www.mindysmith.net/">Mindy Smith</a> today. Well, rung up her purchase anyway. She's a musician here in Nashville.
