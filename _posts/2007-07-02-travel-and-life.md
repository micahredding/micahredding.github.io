We just got back from a great weekend, involving a trip to WV, spending some time with our grandparents, hauling a large radio antenna across town on top of our car, getting stung by a wasp, staying out until 2am, dealing with some "interesting" characters, and playing like crazy.

Enjoying what you do?<br /><br />How do you keep what you do enjoyable?<br /><br />How do you stay motivated?<br /><br />How do you know if you're going the right direction?<br /><br />-micah
