We had a great night last Friday at Borders. Lots of you guys came out, we really enjoyed it, and it even made us feel better (we were all sick that day).<br /><br />Also in the audience were members of <a href="http://www.srorocks.com/">SRO</a>. Check them out.<br /><br />And if you still haven't done it, check out the <a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/photos/">photo of us with the Mystery Machine</a>.<br /><br />Until next time...
