I want to start writing about a subject that fascinates me: how to live lightly.

This involves many things. For me, it ideally means
<ol>
	<li>Traveling with only one bag</li>
	<li>Carrying very few things in my pockets</li>
	<li>Not accumulating possessions</li>
	<li>Keeping all my data "in the cloud", beyond the dangers of dropping laptops in swimming pools</li>
</ol>
These things may seem random, but the core idea is the same: I want to be able to travel, change direction at a moment's notice, and live life without worrying about possessions or information.

I intend to document some of my thoughts and strategies in getting towards this goal. Right now, I'll list a few of my inspirations.

</ul>
