On Sunday afternoon, we performed at Meghan's birthday party...<br /><br />AT THE HURRICANE PARK!<br /><br />Ok, so normally, playing outside would be great, fantastic even.<br /><br />BUT IT WAS SNOWING!<br /><br />That's right, we played outside in the freezing cold. After a while, our desperation got so intense, we started doing techno remixes of old country songs.<br /><br />And we liked it!<br /><br />So now we're going to forget this regular music and go off to Nashville to become the first techno-country band.<br /><br />Errr...<br /><br />-Micah
