I think theistic transhumanism is important because eventually people are going to become aware of the simulation argument - and when that happens, people will either see themselves in an adversarial relationship with the creator of their reality, or in a partnership with the creator of their reality. 

That perspective is perhaps the most important determination we can make - because it determines whether or not we see ourselves as cut off from our own existence.
