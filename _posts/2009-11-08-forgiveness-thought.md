Think about this.<div><br /></div><div>Jesus went around forgiving people, and claiming the authority to forgive sins. Further, he freely offered this forgiveness, without requiring anything of the people who sought him.</div><div><br /></div><div>But when Jesus did this, he had not yet died. And yet, he claimed he could forgive sins.</div><div><br /></div><div>If Jesus could forgive sins at any time, could God forgive sins at any time?</div>
