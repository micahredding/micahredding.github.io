CHARLESTON, WV - The Redding Brothers' self-produced demo album "Rough Draft" has now officially sold out! Not to worry, plans are already being made for a reprint that should be ready in a couple of weeks. And of course, the Reddings are gearing up for a new album, featuring the single "Jane Fonda". The Jane Fonda single is actually in the polishing stages, and will soon be uploaded to the site. Beta Testers described it as "rocking", "awesome", and "makes me hungry".
