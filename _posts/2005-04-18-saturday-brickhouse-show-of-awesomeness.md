So Saturday was basically awesome. The bands were<br />-One Last Call<br />-Fletcher's Grove<br />-<a href="http://www.vintagetone.net/">Vintage Tone</a><br />-<a href="http://www.jiants.net/">The Jiants</a><br />...and of course, us.<br /><br />We had an awesome snowcone machine, a movie called "Santa Claus Conquers The Martians", new merchandise, cheap concessions, a new sing-a-long song, and a "concert library", where you could check out books like "It's great to have a wolf around the house", or "The Worst-Case Scenario Action Hero's Guide".<br /><br />Around 70 people showed up (which is more than we've ever seen at any Brickhouse show we've been to) and the audience was great.<br /><br />-The Redding Brothers<br /><br /><br />PS. Rayvenn, Hannah, and Bailey helped us out, and for that receive the title Fantastic People of Fantasticability!
