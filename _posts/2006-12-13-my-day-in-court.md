So the other day I went to court. It turns out that we had tried to buy a house a while back, and when the bank appraised the house, they came back and said, "it ain't worth that much". So the deal fell through, and our offer was legally broken.<br /><br />Well, thanks to a nice little thing called earnest money, the story doesn't end there. The earnest money should have come back to us; the contract was broken through no fault of our own, and the contract specifically stated that in that situation, we would get the earnest money back.<br /><br />But the seller didn't see it that way. They did some shady things, our agents dropped the ball a bit, and at the end of the day, they had a decent chance of winning their argument in court.<br /><br />On the day of the hearing, we showed up, preparing to argue this ourselves. The opposing party showed up with their high-powered, slick-dealing, somewhat shady real estate agent. It was a David vs. Goliath battle. And then the court said we'd have to reschedule, and sent us out to discuss a possible date.<br /><br />So we talked to these people, and they tried their very best to intimidate us, to subtly threaten to come after us with damages, blah blah blah...<br /><br />And I decided to let it go.<br /><br />It was a lot of money for me, but not THAT much money. Not enough to want to go through the court process again; not enough to want to spend my time thinking about it; not enough to make me want to devote my mental energy to these shady, scummy people.<br /><br />So I wrote it off. I KNEW that I shouldn't have gotten involved in the court system in the first place; I knew it wasn't a place I wanted to be.<br /><br /><blockquote>"Make friends quickly with your opponent at law while you are with him on the way, so that your opponent may not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison." - Jesus, Matthew 5:25</blockquote><br />Jesus took a dim view of the legal system. He suggested alternative ways for resolving issues...and if those didn't work, he told people to just let it be.<br /><br />Might be something I should take into consideration.<br /><br />-micah<br /><a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/">http://www.reddingbrothers.com/</a>
