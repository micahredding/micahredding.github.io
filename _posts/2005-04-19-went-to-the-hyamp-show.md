So after all this Brickhouse madness, of course I had to go to someone else's show at HYAMP. <a href="http://www.neutralagreement.com/">Neutral Agreement</a>, <a href="http://www.theapprenticemusic.com/">The Apprentice</a>, Terminal, and <a href="http://www.thejulianatheory.com/">Juliana Theory</a> were playing. The <a href="http://www.jiants.net/">Jiants</a> were also there, as well as <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thepresentcrisis">The Present Crisis</a> and a bunch of other people...and Julianna Theory was awesome.<br /><br />-micah
