Theistic Reality is a term I coined (for myself, anyway) to refer to the set of expectations we would have about a reality in which God exists. Since it is nearly impossible to define what "God" means as a being, our best bet is to lay out what kinds of implications God would have for the rest of existence.

Example 1: [Believe or Don't Believe](http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/10/05/believe-or-dont-believe)  
Example 2: [The Existence of God](http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/13/existence-god)  

For me and my understanding of God, this means primarily that there is a trajectory of real progress and learning in the cosmos, that history is real, and that our experienced lives are significant. Oh, and that in some way, we are immortal.
