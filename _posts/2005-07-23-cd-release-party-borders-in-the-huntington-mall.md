Just wanted to let you know that after over a year of delaying, we're finally releasing our <strong>first-ever</strong> full-length studio-quality album, <strong><em>Green Shag Carpet</em></strong>. It's gonna feature 10 of our newest songs with a little more of a rock edge than you're probably used to with us. Also, rumor has it that the <strong>CD will also include some bonus material</strong> (that's top secret information for now though :-).<br /><br />The CD will be officially released on <strong>Friday, July 22nd, 8:00 pm, at the Borders Cafe in the Huntington Mall</strong>.
