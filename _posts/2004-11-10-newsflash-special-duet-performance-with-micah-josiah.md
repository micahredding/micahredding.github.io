As some of you may know, a few weeks ago Gabe took a trip to Seattle, WA to visit some friends of ours. As originally planned, he was supposed to get back in plenty of time for our upcoming show at WVSU on the 11th. Unfortunately, due to some car trouble, Gabe won't be able to make it back for the show. Instead, tomorrow (the 11th) Micah and Josiah will be doing a special duet performance — not heard in over 4 years — at WVSU! This show is sure be one of a kind, so be sure to come out and see it! Details: Thursday, November 11, 4:00 PM at WVSU Student Plaza. Admission: FREE!
