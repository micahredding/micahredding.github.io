<span style="font-weight:bold;">Clouds (w:m micah redding)</span><br /><br />A long time ago, a nation very far away<br />Young men stood on a hillside, dreaming of another day<br />They never knew what this would lead to, all these visions, all these things<br />All they knew was that they'd never lose the power of the dream<br /><br />And now a thousand years later, and a million miles since<br />You can still hear them coming, hear their voices in the wind, they're singing<br />A million different cities where the people cried aloud<br />You could hear the changes coming in the clouds<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />[It came in the clouds that day<br />Blowing open heaven's gates<br />Coming in on the winds of change<br />The day it all came down<br />That day was filled with clouds]</span><br /><br />They saw a new heaven and earth, a new birth, new universe, born right here on the earth<br />They knew that if this was to happen everything would have to change<br />They'd bring the revolution and the day<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><br />[chorus]<br /></span><br /><br />The change they knew was coming never took them by surprise<br />But lifted them unspoken with the winds into the skies<br />And now you can hear their voices, all eternity they cry<br />Immortal they're a beacon in the sky<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">[chorus]</span>
