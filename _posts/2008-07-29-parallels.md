Inspired by "Everything Must Change", by Brian McLaren, here is a list of parallels.<br /><br />Thinking you can avoid the result of sexual promiscuity through abortion, and...<br />Thinking you can avoid the result of environmental abuse and pollution.<br /><br />Believing the proliferation of condoms will cause sex to happen, and...<br />Believing the proliferation of guns will cause killings to happen.
