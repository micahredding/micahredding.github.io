The Marriot we stayed at had a very helpful sign to let us know not to drive up on the grass.<br /><br />On Friday, we decided to drive through Iowa City, exploring the wildlife, admiring the prarie, and picking up a big screen tv from the rental center. When looking for a parking spot, we accidentally parked right in front of a coffeeshop. Since there were <em>20 minutes</em> (remember that number, it'll be important later) left on the parking meter, we decided to go in and partake of their offerings.<br /><br />The shop was mysterious and Asian. Outside, it looked tiny - inside, it was huge. It was dimly lit, and smelled as if Hungarian poets made it their regular hang-out. We were in the middle of Iowa, smelling like Hungarian-Asian-magical-poetic coffee. What were we to think?<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RwGuteuPYDI/AAAAAAAAACI/TWTU9EKgkks/s1600-h/PICT0991.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RwGuteuPYDI/AAAAAAAAACI/TWTU9EKgkks/s320/PICT0991.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>When our customized frozen drinks were delivered, instead of having lids, they were wrapped as if they were pre-packaged. We were amazed! How did they get those plasticized lids on there? We couldn't peal them off, we knew they weren't pre-made, and the straw went straight through. We could only conclude that they had some crazy magic cup-laminating machine in the back.<br /><br />Unfortunately, their magic machine was slow, and we didn't get out until <em>25 minutes</em> (this is where that earlier number I told you to remember comes back into play) later - only to find our time expired and a ticket on our windshield.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RwGu6uuPYEI/AAAAAAAAACQ/wMgYnzKoMfs/s1600-h/PICT0997.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RwGu6uuPYEI/AAAAAAAAACQ/wMgYnzKoMfs/s320/PICT0997.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />The police-folk of Iowa City are timely and prompt. If only I had thought to read <em>The  Visitor's Guide to Parking in Iowa City</em>. Maybe then none of this would have happened.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RwGvF-uPYFI/AAAAAAAAACY/Y9YqZF226dU/s1600-h/PICT0999.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RkQnU8sPjpM/RwGvF-uPYFI/AAAAAAAAACY/Y9YqZF226dU/s320/PICT0999.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />- The End
