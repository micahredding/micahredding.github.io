A few months ago, I gave a talk entitled “The Infinite Resurrection” at the annual conference of the [Mormon Transhumanist Association](http://transfigurism.org/). The MTA are always great hosts, and I enjoyed the opportunity to meet and talk with many of the other speakers. 

Like many of the others there, I am not Mormon, and my talk was not on Mormonism. Instead, I spoke about a subject that was extremely important, and yet incredibly controversial, from the very earliest moments of Christianity: The resurrection of the body.

Why was resurrection *of the body* considered so important? What was the significance of insisting on the resurrection of the dead, rather than the *immortality of the soul* that was so popular with Plato and other philosophers? 

Put another way, why did Christians stand out like a sore thumb in the ancient Roman Empire?

In this short talk, I give three reasons I think resurrection was so incredibly important to early Christians, and the one thing that was unique in early Christian teaching. 

In short, *resurrection provokes action*.
