I had to do something productive this weekend, so I went out a bought something I'd been wanting for a while...<br /><br />Velcro Shoes.<br /><br />I haven't had a pair since I was six, and once I started thinking about them, I just couldn't stop. I had to have a pair. So I bought them: the gray pair with the arch supports.<br /><br />I love them. I'm wearing them now. Sometimes I just look at them.<br /><br />They're great.<br /><br />-micah
