Just a short list of things that have inspired me to really feel life, even if only briefly.

<strong>A New Earth
</strong>...made me look at leaves differently, made me feel alive

<strong>The Inescapable Love of God</strong>
...begins theologically in depth, but ended making me feel the purpose of everything I experience

<strong>A video about deciding Who You Are</strong>
A PG-rated talk about focusing on your creative work, and not getting distracted by people selling stuff

The last one is by no means as deep as the other stuff. But it is a video you can watch right this moment, and it inspired me to start writing a song tonight.
