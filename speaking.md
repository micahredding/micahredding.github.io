### What you can expect

Here's what you can expect from me:

* Prompt, professional replies to your phone calls and emails.
* A personal consultation prior to your event, so I can best understand how to serve you and your audience.
* A professional and dynamic presentation tailored to your needs.
* A quick follow-up communication after the event to make sure I met your expectations. (I also want to know how you think I can improve.)

### About Me

I've spoken at TEDx, been interviewed on TV, radio, and podcasts, have presented to audiences of all kinds, and have hosted public conversations all around the world.

My focus is on humanity's incredible potential, how we can use technology for good, and how our religious and spiritual traditions can work together to create a better future for us all. I regularly speak about religion to secular audiences, and about the importance of the secular to religious audiences.

I'm a software developer, founder and Executive Director of the [Christian Transhumanist Association](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org), and host of the [Christian Transhumanist Podcast](https://www.christiantranshumanism.org/podcast). I grew up as a preacher's kid, spent eight years as a rock musician, and have traveled extensively, to places such as Kathmandu, Afghanistan, and the coasts of Africa. In 2012, I found myself in Tahrir Square during the aftermath of the Egyptian revolution.

As a software developer, I have worked with startups to strategically lay the groundwork for open-ended growth, led development on multi-million dollar web products, and helped larger companies dramatically accelerate their development process.

I live in Nashville, Tennessee, where I coordinate inter-religious dialogue, cutting-edge art events, and public conversations on the technological singularity and the future of the human race. I'm a member of Mensa, a frequent contributor to the Huffington Post and Vice Motherboard, and a speaker for TEDx and numerous other events.
