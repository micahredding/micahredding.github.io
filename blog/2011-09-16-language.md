I used to think that maybe we could find new words, and re-express Christianity in different language.

Right now, I think that idea is probably futile. Christianity without the language of fall, redemption, and salvation is probably not Christianity. 

At least, it's not recognizably Christian, and anyone who undertakes the task of this re-verbalizing will probably be doing it with such a slant, it will be unnatural and distorted. Christianity is what it is because its language is rich and deep and pervasive, fitting itself to new situations and new peoples over and over and over again. It has worn itself into deep poetry over the millennia, and will continue to do so for as far as we can see.
