The Capitol Roasters show was great...but we ran 46 minutes over schedule! We squeezed a lot of talented people into our roster, and although the show was barely advertised, the turnout was high. Because of the time, we were only able to play three songs...thanks to the staff for putting up with us! :)<br /><br />Anyway, hopefully we'll be able to make this a monthly event. And it should only get better from here.<br /><br />-micah
