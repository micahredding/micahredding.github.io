This is the deal with violence. It works. Sort of. But the problem is, it only works on one level. It can stop a person from doing something you don't like, but it can't change a person's mind. It can't win the hearts and minds of a people, or even of a pretty girl. It can't get us any of the things we really want.

And so violence is an approach to the world the gives up the good things we want out of life. And the only reason we would make that trade-off is because of fear, or maybe blindness.

In fact, it seems to be the case that if you engage in violence, you can't really ever partake of the higher pleasures and accomplishments the world offers. To deal with this, the rich out-source their violence to others, so they can experience the good life.
