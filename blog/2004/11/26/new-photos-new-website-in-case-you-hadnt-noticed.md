We've just posted some new photos on our photos page (imagine that). Anyway, some of them are from our Battle of The Bands Show, and you might be in them. Warning: Some of the pictures are kinda large, and might take a while to load. We're actually working on downsizing them right now.
<br />
<br />Also, if you hadn't noticed, our website has been revamped again. Let us know what you like/dislike about the new design. The new setup allows you to leave comments on just about everything here, from the pictures to this post itself. Just look for the "comments" line below, and click it. If you've ever used a blog, you shouldn't have a problem with this.
<br />
<br />That's it for now. It snowed today - it's time to drink some eggnog.
