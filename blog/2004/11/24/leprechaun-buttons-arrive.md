After a long and anguished wait, the "I Found A Leprechaun" Buttons have ARRIVED!
<br />
<br />Featuring a handsome Leprechaun, these 1-inch buttons are perfect for everything you use buttons for, and make great Christmas gifts for those who you don't want to spend much money on. For those you do want to spend a lot of money on, buy 100 buttons.
<br />
<br />In top-secret news (shhh!), another yet-undisclosed button is already in production.
<br />
<br />The Leprechaun Buttons are 2 for $1, and will be available at our next show.
