08/25/04 - The Redding Brothers debuted their show in Cincinnati last weekend to a great response. The Borders at Eastgate Mall hosted this concert on Saturday, August 21 at 7:30 p.m., and Cincinattians and out-of-towners alike all made their way to Eastgate to see the Redding Brothers debut. Thanks Cincinatti, for a great show! We hope to see you all again at Dayton this weekend!
