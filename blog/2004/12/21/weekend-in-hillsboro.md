We played in Hillsboro, Oh on Friday, and it was great. Never been to that town before, but it was fun with the whole old-building/smalltown-life thing going on. Definitely looks like a Christmas movie.
<br />
<br />Playing in the Colony Theater was cool. It was an old classic-style thing, and our name was up in lights. Woohoo.
<br />
<br />They put us on a bit too early, before most of the people were there, but it was still cool, and a lot of fun.
<br />
<br />For those of you not familiar with Ohio, they have these funky stores called "United Dairy Farmers". They're basically just weirdly-named 7-Elevens, with more Ice Cream. We found these things there called "Micro-Shakes". They're milkshakes that come frozen, and you microwave them to make them ready-to-eat.
<br />
<br />Those definitely deserve a mention.
