9/24/04 - The concert that almost didn't happen. First of all, electricity went down all over town, taking out traffic lights, convenience stores, and half of the venue! Traffic was a nightmare, half the coffeeshop was dark, and only half of the regular menu of drinks could be made. Then, it got worse. ALL the electricity went out. We were gearing up to perform in the dark, when Gabe declared loudly, "This is not my fault!", and the electricity spontaneously came on all over town.
<br />
<br />The subsequent concert was upbeat, a little bit crazy, and fun as usual (for us, anyway).
