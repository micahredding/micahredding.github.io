In the past 3 months or so, I have had hardly any time. Thus, the fact that it has been a while since I posted on this blog. I have been living the crazy, leave-work-and-immediately-leave-town-for-another-show-or-maybe-6 kind of lifestyle. We've had several weekends with back-to-back-to-back shows. One day, we did about 6 shows one right after another. Our tour calendar counted this as one show since it was all crammed together. That same weekend, we did three other appearances.<br /><br />We did a TON of work preparing for the Civic Center Show. It was a huge deal, and an immense amount of work.<br /><br />And we got to step up our show by a lot. People said it was the best show they'd ever seen. Period.<br /><br />There were, however, an immense amount of technical difficulties. So even though people loved the show and said it was the most intense and best ever, I know it could have been even MORE intense. Other people don't know, but I know. I know how much more ridiculously awesome it could have been.<br /><br />Which just means next time, it will be mind-blowing.<br /><br />-micah
