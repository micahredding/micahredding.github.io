The understanding of Christianity and the scriptures as speaking directly to experienced realities, rather than trying to map metaphysical existence.

This view was inspired [here](http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/12/19/imputed-righteousness-and-switching-tracks), and is explained [here](http://micahredding.com/blog/2011/12/23/imputed-righteousness-part-2). An example of how to understand "Jesus is Lord" in a non-metaphysical way is [here](http://micahredding.com/blog/2009/12/13/jesus-is-lord). My assertion is that this non-metaphysical understanding is actually the original intent, as understood through [Historical Narrative Interpretation](http://micahredding.com/blog/2012/02/04/historical-narrative-interpretation). 

To preempt any potential misunderstandings, this is not an atheistic reading. Rather, it emerges from the biblical understanding of God as intimately involved in our physical world.
