Okay, so I don't really know what I meant by "SLAMMED", but it made it sound more interesting, didn't it?<br /><br />So anyway, we got a call at 12:30am Friday night (Saturday morning), and found out that we were wanted for a Brickhouse show Saturday night. So we did it. And it rocked. The lineup:<br /><br />The Present Crisis<br />The Redding Brothers (that's us)<br />Another Band that was real hard<br /><a href="http://www.betteroffdreaming.com/">Better Off Dreaming</a> - awesome!<br /><a href="http://www.neutralagreement.com/">Neutral Agreement</a> - rock-o-rific!<br /><br />And BTW, we're experimenting with different messageboard systems, so try this one out: <a href="http://redding.boardsxp.com/">http://redding.boardsxp.com/</a><br /><br />-us
