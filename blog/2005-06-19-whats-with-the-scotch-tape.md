Last night we played at the Attic Club in Dayton, OH, and there really weren't very many people there at all. But that's all good...because the people that were there were the COOLEST EVER, and we got to meet some of them and explain things like our brown zip-up necktie, our vintage "old man" style suitcase, and our leprechaun paraphernalia. We also got to discuss the latest topics and issues, like who were those girls that were running around putting scotch tape on everyone's shoulders. And we got to play with some cool bands, including <a href="http://www.inthered.us" target="_blank">In The Red</a>, who are another 3 peice band that had an incredible sound (thanks for the CD guys!). Anyway, we had a blast and we hope everyone else did to. Thanks for coming!<br /><br />-Josiah
