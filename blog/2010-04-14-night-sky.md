Tonight I looked up at the clouds, and the sky beyond them, and the stars beyond that. And I thought that people were not meant to live only under the clouds, but that one day, we might climb up a little higher, and reach above them. I might reach above them.

There are places above the sky that I need to be. There are parts of this universe that seem meant for us to explore.

And I think that we will, that our lives will stretch out in front of us, and we will continue outward and upward into the vastness.
