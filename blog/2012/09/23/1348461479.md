I see technology not as a thing in itself, but something which emerges from humanity, like an anthill emerges from an ant colony. If you take the ants away from the anthill, they will build a new one. In the same way, humans will always invent and innovate. If you take away their technology, humans will invent new technology. And just as the anthill is home for the ants, and a crucial part of their flourishing, our ability to express our creativity through invention is crucial to our flourishing.
