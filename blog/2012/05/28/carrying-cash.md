*I'm in the middle of a 40-day, 16 stop, 14 country tour of the world. The most annoying thing about this trip so far has been using currency.*

Carrying cash does not make me feel powerful. Carrying cash makes me feel vulnerable, like a target. Carrying cash makes me feel tied down, nervous about keeping track of what I've got on me. 

*Without* cash, I can walk unafraid into bad neighborhoods and dark alleys. Without cash, I can approach strangers with open hands. Without cash, I have a ready and honest answer to all who ask for money. 

*With* cash, I am likely to spend more. With cash, I can negotiate for a low price, but must then face the awkwardness of asking for change. With cash, I am more likely to miscalculate, make rounding errors, or accidentally drop too much. With cash, I am always worrying about whether my bills are too large, too small, or too few. 

With cash, I am a slave to the whims of paper, moisture, and rips and tears. *Without* cash, I feel free.
