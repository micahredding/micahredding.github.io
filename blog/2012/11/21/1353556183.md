It is so improbable that we will pass out of existence forever. Rather, the very structure of reality hints to us, suggests to us that we will continue, that existence stretches far beneath us, and that even if we are to fall out of this world, we will land in a reality more deep and nuanced than we can imagine. There is no other probability, really, and the more we discover, the bigger and dramatically more complex the universe begins to be seen. Everywhere there are multiverses, and soon, everywhere will be seen immortalities.
