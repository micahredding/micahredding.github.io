The future is something that people, by and large, don't believe in. That's why I thought it was amazing when Frank Tipler, a physicist, realized that in order to do physics on any real scale, he had to study the physics of the future of the universe.

Why? Because THE FUTURE IS SO MUCH LARGER than the past. Even from a purely size-based analysis, using only what science currently knows, the future universe is not only hundreds (thousands, millions?) of times larger than it is now, but the future timespan of our universe is IMMENSELY longer than the past.

Frank Tipler estimates that the universe is less than 20 billion years old, and will continue AT LEAST another 100 billion years into the future.

Think about what life will and must do on that scale of time. Humanity is in a position to sway the entire universe.
