I called in to a talk show today and shared my views on immigration. It's something I've wanted to do for a while just for the experience, so I've finally done it. It was interesting, they had me wait on the phone for a long time, and then cut me off without letting me respond to his comments. Which is pretty much what I expected.<br /><br />Anyway, another interesting experience down. 5 Million to go.<br /><br />-Micah
