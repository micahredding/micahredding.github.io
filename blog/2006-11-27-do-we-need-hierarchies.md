A guy named <a href="http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/2380813">Sig talks about why we don't need hierarchies</a> in companies, and a friend of his <a href="http://www.undefined.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-tb.cgi/159">challenged him with a few objections</a>...<br /><br /><blockquote>*  Hierarchies are the natural, programmed organizational model hard-wired into our brains. Other models are not intuitive the way a hierarchy is to an average person.<br /></blockquote><br />Explain colors with a hierarchy. Explain the crop cycle, the water cycle, the weather, with a hierarchy. "Intuitive" is not where hierarchies live.<br /><br /><blockquote>* Without hierarchies, how can you escalate issues?<br /></blockquote><br />Involve more and more people. Exactly the system Jesus suggested for resolving disputes. Bring the issue to the other party; if they won't resolve it with you, bring a friend, then more friends, finally, everyone related. Jesus didn't allow a hierarchy in his system for resolving disputes.<br /><br />-micah
