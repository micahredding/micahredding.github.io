I write about life on the curve of accelerating change, christianity as the anti-religion, and my attempts at adventures and excursions in the new world. 

I currently run two emails lists, one for my religious interests, one for my thoughts about life in the era before the singularity. Sign up for them here:  
[christianity against religion](http://christianityagainstreligion.com/group)  or  [life on the curve](http://micahredding.com/curve).
