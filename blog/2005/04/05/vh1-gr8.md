Friday night with Junior at <a href="http://www.commongroundsoflexington.com">Common Grounds</a> was great - he turned out to be a highly creative songwriter, one of the most interesting I've seen. Siah, though, was stuck in Nashville and did't make it until our show was over. Which meant that Gabe and I had to play by ourselves.<br /><br />So that was an interesting twist on things.<br /><br />We spent the night in Georgetown (right above Lexington), and then headed up to Dayton through blinding rain and wind. We thought we were done for, but neither snow, nor rain, nor dark of night will keep us from our appointed tourdates. Almost makes you feel patriotic. Errr...anyway.<br /><br />So we played at the VH1 Save The Music concert (at the <a href="http://www.udayton.edu/">University of Dayton</a>), which was awesome. The fraternity girls (yes, you read right...we were confused too) who hosted it were in Sigma Alpha Iota. Okay, we admit it, they were awesome, even if they <i>were</i> MEAN to us.<br /><br />So then we headed home, stopping off at Taco Bell to fill Gabe's ravenous hunger before plunging onward into the night towards WV. Another mission accomplished.<br /><br />-micah
