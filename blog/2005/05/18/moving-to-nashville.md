Okay, well I'm gonna start journaling my experiences in moving...<br /><br />Thursday was my last day at Rendezvous in Teays Valley, WV, and on Sunday I made the drive to Nashville. I was hired to work at the new Apple Computer store in the Green Hills section of Nashville as a Part-Time Mac Specialist.<br /><br />The normal training was supposed to be on the weekends...but I wasn't able to do that because I'm all booked up on the weekends for weeks. So I was told I would be put in the through-the-week training. Then I was told that it was full, and that I couldn't come. So here I was in Nashville on Sunday night, not knowing if my training was actually going to happen, not having any info from anyone, and not knowing what to do.<br /><br />So I just deduced where and when the training was, and showed up Monday morning. Fortunately, they let me in, and let me start. :)<br /><br />-micah
