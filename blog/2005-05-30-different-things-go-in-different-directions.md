We've got interesting stuff going on here behind the scenes. The other day I tried street performing for the first time, and met some interesting people. I only stayed out there for a couple of minutes, but it was fun, and a good experience, I think. I also checked out a local venue in Nashville called <a href="http://www.rcktwn.com/">Rocketown</a>, which is AWESOME. I'm dying to play there.<br /><br />After doing those things, I hit an open mic with some really good quality performers.<br /><br />Then this weekend, I was in the wedding of my old roomate, and spent some time in Alabama with my grandparents.<br /><br />...Meanwhile, back in internet world...<br /><br />If you've followed us over the last two years, you've probably noticed a lot of website changes. What you are seeing right now is the fourth major, from the bottom up, rebuild of our entire site.<br /><br />Well, we're gearing up for the fifth. Expect a huge leap forward in what you are able to do here, and the stuff that's available.<br /><br />Expect to be amazed....woooooo....<br /><br />-micah
