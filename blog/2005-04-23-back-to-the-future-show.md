No, we didn't play the Back To The Future theme song. Instead, we rehashed our artistic history by playing our songs in the chronological order of when they were written, bringing back a bunch of songs we hadn't sung in years.<br /><br />This show was at the Huntington Borders, and it was a lot of fun for us. The Borders people told us there were 102 people standing around.<br /><br />Also, I got a special present which made this show awesome. It was a "Jolly Lemon" flag; a lemon and crossbones made by Hannah Bird and Bailey.<br /><br />Don't ask.<br /><br />But it was awesome.<br /><br />-micah
