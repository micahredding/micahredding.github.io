I have this dream...a dream where I am awake in the wee hours of the morning, looking out over the city, writing songs. In this dream, I live on the edge of the road, and every day means new cities and new experiences, and all I ever have to think about is how to make the most out of my time, how to enjoy my life as much as possible. And I already have the answer. In my dream, I spend my time writing songs, designing cool things, performing on stage, traveling, and exploring the world.<br /><br />To me, this is freedom. It's what I dream about when I stand outside at dusk and look up at the sky. It's what it means to me to be "self-employed". If I can make enough money to survive doing the things I love, I will no longer have to split my energy between life and work, because one will be the other.<br /><br />Over the weekend, we traveled up to Peoria, IL, stopping at some fun and interesting places along the way. Like the gas station/motel/apartment/playground that formed the majority of "town-age" at one exit. It was a weird scene, but it was another experience you just can't have sitting at home.<br /><br />Anyway, on the trip I wrote a new song I'm calling "Shoulder", a song that is one of those stay-up-writing-in-your-motel-room kind of songs. The ones that I dream about. There's just a certain quality from those you don't normally get.<br /><br />I need to work on more normal rock songs, though. Trying to continually develop my song-writing ability tends to make me stray into weirder and weirder styles.<br /><br />Creativity is a constant balancing act. Just something to think about.<br /><br />-micah
