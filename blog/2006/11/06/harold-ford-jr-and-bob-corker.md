I was listening to the radio talk about how the Tennessee Senate election (between Bob Corker and Harold Ford Jr) was a "race issue", when I passed by some "Women for Ford" on the side of the road. I rolled down my window to hear what they were screaming, and saw a lady beating her sign against the ground, saying "Harold Ford! Harold Ford!".<br /><br />Someone else in traffic had their window down too, and they were screaming "Bob Corker! Bob Corker!"<br /><br />These two individuals just screamed back and forth at each other like this for a while.<br /><br />And I just wondered at how silly people are willing to be.<br /><br />-micah
