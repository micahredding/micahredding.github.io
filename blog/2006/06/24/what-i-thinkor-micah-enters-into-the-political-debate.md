I hate politics.<br /><br />And thus the source of my political opinion. Because politics is all about everything that is worst in the world. Political races are brutal struggles for power. Power that is then used to steal, murder, cheat, lie, and corrupt.<br /><br />What, after all, is the source of government power? In the final analysis, it all comes down to violence. Guns and violence. If you don't pay your taxes, they will use guns to force you to do so. If you don't wear your seatbelt, they will fine you. And that fine means nothing except for the fact that if you don't pay it, they will ultimately threaten you with violence.<br /><br />Taxes are just prettied up theft.<br />Federal laws are no different than the rules laid down by the local mob.<br /><br />And the legitimacy of the government is just fancy clothing on a rotten corpse.<br /><br />-micah
