The <a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/snow">SNOW EP</a> was a project born of interestingness. It began as a concert that we planned to do in December of 2004 at "the Brickhouse", a small hole-in-the-wall kind of venue in St Albans, WV. It would be a Christmas Show with all the trappings. And so we practiced, and we came up with all the Christmas Carols we could sing.<br /><br />And then we attempted <a href="http://www.myspace.com/reddingbrothers">Carol of The Bells</a>.<br /><br />For people who are not familiar with this song, it is a ridiculously complex song. That is, if you're trying to sing it with only three guys. But we were determined to try.<br /><br />And that attempt led us to break down the song to its essential elements. The elements of intensity and passion and power, and...<br /><br />...yippee-i-oh, yippee-i-oh-ay?<br /><br />Yes, even that one.<br /><br />It was a bold move, but one we were determined to make. And so we came up with our time-pattern-changing, genre-crossing, old-west-cowboy-rock-Christmas version of this song.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Brickhouse concert was delayed for a couple of months, and the genius of our song would not be revealed for another year. Instead, the next Brickhouse show was the record-breaking, history-setting, all-time favorite REDDING BROTHERS BRICKHOUSE show of March of 2005. Carol of The Bells would have to wait.<br /><br />But only until the next Christmas. And in Christmas of 2005, the show was set to happen in the Teays Valley Cinemas theater of Scott Depot, WV.<br /><br />It was the first concert of its kind; no one had played a show in the <span style="font-style:italic;">theater</span> before. And so we decided that we needed to have a commemorative CD, an EP that would serve for all time to mark the point that a band first held a concert in the Teays Valley Theater.<br /><br />And so SNOW was born. It contained "Carol of The Bells", "Angels We Have Heard on High", our own original "Lord of Winter", the feel-good "Summer Girl Snow", and a haunting piano piece named "Winter in F#m".<br /><br />"Lord of Winter" is an interesting track; an example of a song that dips deep into the well of the movie "It's a Wonderful Life" for a introspective take on the season. But that's another story.<br /><br />-micah<br /><br /><hr />PS. Just in case you hadn't heard, there's one last chance for you to get the <a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/snow">SNOW Christmas EP </a>right before Christmas. It can still make it there in time!
