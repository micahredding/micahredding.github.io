My Mormon friends say that religion is an expression of our aspiration. Our belief that God is love is indistinguishable from our desire to be love ourselves. Our belief that God is holy is indistinguishable from our desire to be pure.

As such, I don't think religion serves the need of security, as much as it gives us hope, and something to aim for, and something to be ambitious about.

Which, to me, sounds a lot like what the OT prophets were concerned about. They didn't like people worshipping idols, because you become what you worship. Instead, they held up a narrative in which God is explicitly a being we are modelled after and are intended to model ourselves after (the point of Genesis 1). And this God is creative and loving and humane.
