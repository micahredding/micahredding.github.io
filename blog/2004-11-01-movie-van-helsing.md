This movie involves Dracula, vampire-wives, Frankenstein AND his monster, Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, the Catholic Church, some creepy people, and a very attractive looking female monster-hunter. Oh yeah, and a lot of cheesy special effects.
<br />
<br />They should have learned from League of Extraordinary Gentlemen not to try to use a huge animated Mr. Hyde character. But they didn't. That's the worst part of this movie. The not-very-masculine Dracula didn't help either.
<br />
<br />But it was entertaining.
<br />
<br />And if you still haven't figured out, Van Helsing is really an amnesiatic archangel Gabriel, the "Left Hand of God".
