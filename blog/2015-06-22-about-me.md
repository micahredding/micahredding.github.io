I’m Micah Redding, a software developer, writer, and the co-founder and executive director of the Christian Transhumanist Association. I grew up as a preacher’s kid, spent eight years as a rock musician, and have traveled to places such as Kathmandu, Afghanistan, and the coast of Africa. In 2012, I found myself in Tahrir Square during the first election after the Egyptian revolution. 

I currently live in Nashville, Tennessee, where I’ve been involved in organizing inter-religious dialogue, cutting-edge art events, and public conversations on the technological singularity and the future of the human race.

Want to contact me? I mostly prefer [email](mailto:micahredding@gmail.com?subject=read%20your%20about%20page). If I haven't responded to you yet, it's probably because I'm thinking deeply about what you've said. Want a third-person version of what I said above? [Here](http://micahredding.com/blog/2014/12/16/about) you go. I like being on podcasts, and having stimulating conversations with people — so if you have a way to make more of that happen, let me know.
