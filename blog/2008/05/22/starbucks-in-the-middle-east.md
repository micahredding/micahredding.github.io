Today I went to Starbucks. This was a Starbucks on a last-stop base in Kuwait, where soldiers come before finally reaching Iraq. My brother came through here when he went through his deployment.<br /><br />I've gone more than 25 days without Starbucks, and now the ability to drink something familiar was an escape - an escape from the Arabic world I've been in for almost a month. Being 6000 miles from home for an extended period of time is something like being on a spaceship - when I'm at home, if I want something, I only have to drive minutes (at most, hours) to reach it. But here, there's nothing I can do. If they don't have something I want, there's nothing I can do to reach it. If I started panicking, and wanted to go home, there's nothing I can do. If I needed contacts, or special guitar equipment, or some rare tools, there's nowhere to go. Even indoor restrooms aren't something taken for granted here.<br /><br />I'm in the desert, over 6000 miles from home, in a place where I've been warned not to venture far. There are anti-American communities nearby, and we stand out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />Starbucks is like an escape, like getting to temporarily step outside the space capsule through a magic doorway, back into my neighborhood. And then walking back through the door and returning to the confined bubble thousands of miles from home.<br /><br />So I ordered my normal drink, and sat inside the Starbucks looking out the windows at the blast barricades surrounding it.
