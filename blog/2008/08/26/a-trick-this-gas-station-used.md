When I was driving through the country-side, looking for the opportunity to refuel, I came upon a gas station selling fuel for $3.19. Or so I thought. Since gas prices had just been over $4.00, this was an amazingly low price. But as I got closer, I could see that gas was actually being sold for $3.39. Clever sign.

Clever and evil.

Gas is $3.19. Or is it?
