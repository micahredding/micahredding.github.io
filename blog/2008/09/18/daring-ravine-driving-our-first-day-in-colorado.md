It was our first day in Colorado. We arrived in Colorado Springs to play in the Glen Eyrie Castle. The only trouble was getting our trailer and equipment TO the castle.

Turns out, they don't make castles for easy trailer-access.

The helpful castle residents informed us we would need to take our trailer out a trail they called the "Fire Road". It would lead us up a steep mountain overtop the castle, and finally to the castle's back door.  And half-way through, we would need to reverse the car and trailer, and take the whole contraption backwards to the entrance.

Video can't really capture the fact that a huge ravine lies directly to your side. But here is our attempt:
