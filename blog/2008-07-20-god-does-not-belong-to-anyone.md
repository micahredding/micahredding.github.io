<p>God does not belong to anyone.</p><br /><br /><p>The merchants of God try to sell him, putting "half price!" and "deep discount!" stickers on him, wrapping ribbons and bows around his little box.</p><br /><br /><p>But he is not theirs to sell.</p><br /><br /><p>And if you take him home, he will escape from the pretty trappings on the mantle, and run through your house, upsetting your pretty little life.</p>
