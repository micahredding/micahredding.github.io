Romans 13 addresses how God uses the cycle of violence to limit itself. This is played out in the Old Testament over and over (Babylon punishing Israel, other nations punishing Babylon), and is foretold or set up in the Genesis story of Noah, when God tells Noah that whoever sheds blood will have his blood shed. 

The idea is that there is an order of self-limiting violence, and an order of peace. Christians should choose to live in the order of peace, and neither revolt against nor participate in the order of violence. After all, those who participate in the order of violence die by the order of violence.
