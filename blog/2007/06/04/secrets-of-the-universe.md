Just to let you know, I do have another blog, in which I am busy answering all the secrets of the universe. Just beware - religion is involved. Ooooh...scary.<br /><br />Currently, I am addressing the <a href="http://emergentchristian.blogspot.com/">problem of why evil exists</a> in the world. I actually do have an answer, even though no one else in history has had one. Other people have pretended to have one, but as I show, they don't really.<br /><br />Do I sound presumptuous? Well, I warned you.<br /><br />-micah
