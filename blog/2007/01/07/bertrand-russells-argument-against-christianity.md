Kevin Beck posted a great analysis of <a href="http://transmillennial.blogspot.com/2007/01/bertrand-russells-assumptionsand-ours.html#links">Bertrand Russell's argument against Christianity</a>.<br /><br />Bertrand Russell said that:<br /><br />1) Jesus said he would return in the first century.<br />2) He didn't return in the first century. Therefore,<br />3) Jesus wasn't correct, and should be rejected.<br /><br />Kevin correctly points out the first statement isn't disputed by many serious biblical critics. The second statement is where Betrand (and most Christians) got it wrong.<br /><br />Atheists have a lot to teach us about looking at the bible honestly.<br /><br />-micah<a href="http://www.reddingbrothers.com/"><br />rock &amp; roll can save the world</a>
