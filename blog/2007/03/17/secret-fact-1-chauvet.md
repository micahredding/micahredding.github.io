This is your first secret fact about the album.<br /><br />Listen to Chauvet with the volume turned up really high. As Gabe was recording the vocals for this song, a couple of people walked in and started laughing. At the very beginning, you will hear this. This is actually something that happened live, and Gabe just decided to leave it on there.<br /><br />Secret Fact #1...<br /><br />-micah
