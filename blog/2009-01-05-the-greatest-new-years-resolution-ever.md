We're setting out to accomplish our resolutions for the new year. And they're going to be entirely different than anything you've ever seen.

<em>The first problem</em> with most resolutions is that they shoot too low. Lose 10 pounds, exercise a little, stop drinking so much egg-nog.

Nobody cares.

And so these resolutions are forgotten as quickly and lightly as they are made.
<blockquote>“Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men’s blood.” (Daniel Burnham)</blockquote>
We’re going to do exactly the opposite of what people normally do. A small group of us has compiled a <a href="http://theresolutionbegins.com/the-list-of-resolutions/">list of resolutions</a> that are life-changing, world-shattering, and above all, BOLD. We are defying the forces of entropy and blandness, and are setting out to make a year that will reverberate with greatness.

<em>The second problem</em> with typical resolutions is that they aim to AVOID something, to hold out on eating that gingerbread man (maybe - hopefully - perhaps) until the month of February. By DEFINITION, these resolutions are broken almost as soon as they are made, as human willpower fails. By the time March rolls around, nothing of those pale resolutions is left.

By contrast, almost all of our resolutions are ACCOMPLISHMENTS, things we can go out and achieve, and once achieved, can never be taken from us.

<em>The third problem</em> with new year’s resolutions is that they’re personal and self-centered. Ours are exactly the opposite, resolutions born of a small group, but spreading and growing in their audacity and scope as they go, inviting and provoking ever more people to join in our great effort.

So we're launching a new website and blog for this fantastic endeavor. And we want you to be a part of it. It's called:
