On Tuesday, we hosted <a href="http://www.checheche.com/">Che Zuro</a> at Rendezvous House of Coffee in Teays Valley. She was on a tour from PA to Nashville to who knows where, and she needed a place to play while coming through WV. So we supplied the sound system, and advertised it, and all that kind of stuff.<br /><br />She was AWESOME. This lady is a great performer. And she was in the movie "Critters" way back in 1987.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.checheche.com/">www.checheche.com</a><br /><br />-micah
