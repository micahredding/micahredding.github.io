So Monday was my first day...<br /><br />It was fun, and I got to meet all my managers at my store, as well as people from all over the country who were training with us. I ate lunch at Backyard Burgers, and ate a Veggie burger, which was actually good.<br /><br />At night I was tired out of my mind. I'm not used to sitting all day...standing, yes. Sitting, no. And eating regular meals, instead of eating all through the day, is hard for me to get used to.<br /><br />I wanted to hit some open mics Monday night, but Bluebird Cafe requires signup at 5:30, and I didn't leave work til 6:00pm. We went to hunt down another one, but it turns out that it was extremely skanky. So I didn't even stop at the place.<br /><br />I may try some street-performing some time...<br /><br />-micah
