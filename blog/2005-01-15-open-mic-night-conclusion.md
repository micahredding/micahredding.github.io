The Open Mic Night went great! It wasn't just fun - we had a lot of high-quality performers. Here is the line-up:
<br />
<br />Timothy C Edmonds - original and often humorous music
<br />Becky Nickerson - folk and variety with acoustic guitar
<br /><a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/4/july.htm">July</a> - double-guitar acoustic rock
<br />Ryan Angus - originals and creatively arranged covers
<br /><a href="http://www.timeanddistance.com/">Greg McGowan (of Time And Distance)</a>
<br />Walt Nordstrom - awesome poetry
<br /><a href="http://www.jiants.net/">The Jiants</a> - doing an acoustic punk set, similar to Relient K and MxPx
<br />and Us...
<br />
<br />We debuted a new song with the working title of "Solid", something I hadn't even finished writing yet, and played a different arrangement of some of our standard songs.
<br />
<br />The whole evening went really great, and we'll probably be doing another one in the near future.
<br />
<br />Thank you all for coming!
