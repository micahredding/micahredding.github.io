This weekend we're doing nothing. Well, sorta. We don't have any concerts. But I am running up to Charleston to hold the auditions for the Capitol Roasters Local Talent Showcase next weekend. This will be the first time we've ever had one there, and I'm excited about it.<br /><br />If anyone is interested in playing there, contact me by <a href="mailto:micahtredding@yahoo.com">email</a>.<br /><br />-micah
