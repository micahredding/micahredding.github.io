The more I am exposed to the Catholic aesthetic, the more I understand that for the ancient church, Mary was sort of like Wonder Woman, working against the power of Kings and Empires to smuggle the divine into the world.

She strides across the ancient map of the world, thwarting everyone’s control, singing a bawdy song about how the powerful will fall, and the poor will rise.

She creates life without the help of man, she reverses the creational order of Adam & Eve, she alone bears witness to the full life of Christ.

She provokes her son into working miracles.

It is no wonder they decided she ascended bodily into heaven. Earth could not contain a power like that[.](https://twitter.com/micahtredding/status/945338999274725382)
